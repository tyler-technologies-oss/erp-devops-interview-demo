# Tyler Technologies ERP DevOps Interview Demo

This git repository contains a simple ASP.NET Core Web App and is used during the technical portion of the interview for a DevOps Engineer in the ERP division at Tyler Technologies. Interviewees should fork this repo and create a pull-request back into the `main` branch after accomplishing the following objectives. 

## Objectives

1. Follow Git best practices to ensure only necessary source files are added to the repository. 
2. Follow GitHub best practices to add checks to ensure that `admins` is the default approver for pull requests, `frontend` is the approver for any `.js` or `.css` files, and `devops` is the approver for anything in the `.github`.
3. Create a GitHub actions workflow file and any other necessary files to build and publish this Web App as a Docker image to DockerHub in a secure manor on any push to `main`.
